            <h2>Universities respond as students demand divestment from Israel</h2>
            <h4>Students have made their divestment demands clear at encampments across the U.S., next steps are up to the universities</h4>
            <h5>By: Ashley Borja, Cullen Fagan, Lauren Rapp, and Sasha Cohen</h5>
    <img src="" alt="">
            <p>Over a month ago, student activists gathered and occupied the heart of Columbia University to demand that the university divest its endowment from weapons manufacturers and companies with ties to Israel. The encampments came after months of nationwide protests calling for a ceasefire in the wake of Israel’s continued attacks on Gaza.</p>
            <p>Since then, students from universities across the country have erected Gaza solidarity encampments on their own campuses. The way universities are responding to students’ divestment demands have ranged from outright rejection, commitment to opening dialogues, and, in a few instances, approval of steps to move forward in the divestment process.</p>

            </script>
            
    
            <p>While a plurality have rejected student demands, nearly a quarter of universities have yet to publicly acknowledge them. 13% are currently negotiating with students or have agreed to vague “future talks,” though some students claim that these negotiations have been used by universities to try to shut down encampments without giving into any demands.</p>

            <p>Almost half of public universities sampled have explicitly rejected student demands, stating they will not or legally cannot divest from Israel. Legal barriers to divestment come in the form of anti-BDS laws in some states that prevent public—and sometimes private—entities from boycotting Israel. Of the universities that have rejected divestment, 88% are in states with these restrictions.</p>
    
            <p>Only 11– including Brown and Dartmouth – have agreed to move forward with considering divestment through scheduled meetings or votes. Of these 11 schools, 8 are private, making divestment more flexible from a legal standpoint.</p>
    
            <p>Evergreen State College in Olympia, Washington has gone the farthest, publicly committing to explore divestment from Israel and calling for a ceasefire, according to the Seattle Times. Evergreen is public, though Washington does not have anti-BDS laws. It is also the alma mater of Rachel Corrie, an American peace activist who was killed by Israeli troops in Gaza in 2003. Student protestors took down their encampment in early May after the university agreed to meet their demands.</p>

            <p><b><em>Methodology</em></b></p>
            <p><em>Our team used the list of universities where students are demanding divestment from Israel that was published by the Chronicle of Higher Education, last updated May 6th, 2024. We checked for news articles and public statements regarding university responses up to May 20th, 2024. Some of this data will likely change as this ongoing situation continues to unfold.</p>
    
            <p>We established five categories to code university responses, which we sorted as I, R, R*, N, and F. We define these categories here:</p>
    
            <table>
                <tr>
                    <th>Response Code</th>
                    <th>Chart/Table Label</th>
                    <th>Definition</th>
                </tr>
                <tr>
                    <td>I</td>
                    <td>No acknowledgement</td>
                    <td>The university has not acknowledged student demands for divestment</td>
                </tr>
                <tr>
                    <td>R</td>
                    <td>Rejection</td>
                    <td>The university has said they cannot or won’t meet student demands for divestment since the encampments began in mid-April.</td>
                </tr>
                <tr>
                    <td>R*</td>
                    <td>Past Rejection</td>
                    <td>The university has not made statements since April 2024 regarding divestment but had stated before then that they will not divest from Israel.</td>
                </tr>
                <tr>
                    <td>N</td>
                    <td>Negotiating</td>
                    <td>The university has said they will continue discussing or reviewing demands with students, but has not made any explicit steps towards divestment.</td>
                </tr>
                <tr>
                    <td>F</td>
                    <td>Moving forward</td>
                    <td>The university has made concrete steps towards future divestment including setting dates for meetings or votes.</td>
                </tr>
                <tr>
                    <td>P</td>
                    <td>Partial acceptance</td>
                    <td>The university has agreed to partially meet student demands for divestment i.e. to divest from weapons manufacturers but not all Israeli companies</td>
                </tr>
            </table>
    
            <p>We sorted university responses into five categories by qualitatively analyzing statements made by universities regarding divestments and encampments, statements made by student organizers, and news coverage reporting on negotiations between students and universities.</p>
    
            <p>As this was a qualitative analysis of sometimes vague language, there were some instances of subjective decision-making and judgment calls to the best of our ability. For example, while Vanderbilt University has not made any public statements regarding divestment, they intervened in the student union to block a divestment referendum. Though it takes some inference, we believe that this instance should be considered rejection, because it implied that the university was not interested in continued discussions about divestment. In some instances, the current stage of the divestment campaign was complex and its categorization may not fully reflect that complexity and instead it is the closest approximation – the chancellor at UMass Amherst, for example, has made statements regarding negotiations that directly contradict the accounts of student and faculty organizers. To mitigate these issues, we collected multiple sources and perspectives to make the best possible approximation of the current situation within our established matrix.</p>
    
            <p>We acknowledge our assessment is limited by the release of public statements and there may be additional information and context to these universities’ stances from emails and notifications that were only shared with university-affiliated individuals - including faculty, students, and administrators. </p>
